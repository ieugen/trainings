<aside class="notes">
    Aspect: a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes. Transaction management is a good example of
    a crosscutting concern in enterprise Java applications. In Spring AOP, aspects are implemented using regular classes
    (the schema-based approach) or regular classes annotated with the @Aspect annotation (the @AspectJ style).

    Join point: a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an
    exception. In Spring AOP, a join point always represents a method execution.

    Advice: action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Different types of advice include "around," "before"
    and "after" advice. (Advice types are discussed below.) Many AOP frameworks, including Spring, model an advice as an
    interceptor, maintaining a chain of interceptors around the join point.

    Pointcut: a predicate that matches join points. Advice is associated with a pointcut expression and runs at any join
    point matched by the pointcut (for example, the execution of a method with a certain name). The concept of join
    points as matched by pointcut expressions is central to AOP, and Spring uses the AspectJ pointcut expression
    language by default.

    Introduction: declaring additional methods or fields on behalf of a type. Spring AOP allows you to introduce new
    interfaces (and a corresponding implementation) to any advised object. For example, you could use an introduction to
    make a bean implement an IsModified interface, to simplify caching. (An introduction is known as an inter-type
    declaration in the AspectJ community.)

    Target object: object being advised by one or more aspects. Also referred to as the advised object. Since Spring AOP
    is implemented using runtime proxies, this object will always be a proxied object.

    AOP proxy: an object created by the AOP framework in order to implement the aspect contracts (advise method
    executions and so on). In the Spring Framework, an AOP proxy will be a JDK dynamic proxy or a CGLIB proxy.

    Weaving: linking aspects with other application types or objects to create an advised object. This can be done at
    compile time (using the AspectJ compiler, for example), load time, or at runtime. Spring AOP, like other pure Java
    AOP frameworks, performs weaving at runtime.
