        Dependency injection is a software design pattern in which one or more dependencies (or services) are injected,
        or passed by reference, into a dependent object (or client) and are made part of the client's state. The pattern
        separates the creation of a client's dependencies from its own behavior, which allows program designs to be
        loosely coupled and to follow the dependency inversion and single responsibility principles.[2][3] It directly
        contrasts the service locator pattern, which allows clients to know about the system they use to find
        dependencies.
