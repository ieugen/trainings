        Because dependency injection doesn't require any change in code behavior it can be applied to legacy code as a
        refactoring. The result is clients that are more independent and that are easier to unit test in isolation using
        stubs or mock objects that simulate other objects not under test. This ease of testing is often the first
        benefit noticed when using dependency injection.
        Dependency injection allows a client to remove all knowledge of a concrete implementation that it needs to use.
        This helps isolate the client from the impact of design changes and defects. It promotes reusability,
        testability and maintainability.[4]
        Dependency injection can be used to externalize a system's configuration details into configuration files
        allowing the system to be reconfigured without recompilation. Separate configurations can be written for
        different situations that require different implementations of components. This includes, but is not limited to,
        testing.
        Reduction of boilerplate code in the application objects since all work to initialize or set up dependencies is
        handled by a provider component.[4]
        Dependency injection allows concurrent or independent development. Two developers can independently develop
        classes that use each other, while only needing to know the interface the classes will communicate through.
        Plugins are often developed by third party shops that never even talk to the developers who created the product
        that uses the plugins.
