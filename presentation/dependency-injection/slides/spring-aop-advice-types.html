<h3>Types of advice</h3>

<ul>
    <li>before</li>
    <li>after</li>
    <li>around</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the simplest one that can do the job.</p>

    Before advice: Advice that executes before a join point, but which does not have the ability to prevent execution
    flow proceeding to the join point (unless it throws an exception).
    After returning advice: Advice to be executed after a join point completes normally: for example, if a method
    returns without throwing an exception.

    After throwing advice: Advice to be executed if a method exits by throwing an exception.
    After (finally) advice: Advice to be executed regardless of the means by which a join point exits (normal or
    exceptional return).

    Around advice: Advice that surrounds a join point such as a method invocation. This is the most powerful kind of
    advice. Around advice can perform custom behavior before and after the method invocation. It is also responsible for
    choosing whether to proceed to the join point or to shortcut the advised method execution by returning its own
    return value or throwing an exception.
