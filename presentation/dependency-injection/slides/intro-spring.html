            The Spring Framework is a lightweight solution and a potential one-stop-shop for building your
            enterprise-ready applications. However, Spring is modular, allowing you to use only those parts that you
            need, without having to bring in the rest. You can use the IoC container, with any web framework on top, but
            you can also use only the Hibernate integration code or the JDBC abstraction layer. The Spring Framework
            supports declarative transaction management, remote access to your logic through RMI or web services, and
            various options for persisting your data. It offers a full-featured MVC framework, and enables you to
            integrate AOP transparently into your software.

            Spring is designed to be non-intrusive, meaning that your domain logic code generally has no dependencies on
            the framework itself. In your integration layer (such as the data access layer), some dependencies on the
            data access technology and the Spring libraries will exist. However, it should be easy to isolate these
            dependencies from the rest of your code base.

            This document is a reference guide to Spring Framework features. If you have any requests, comments, or
            questions on this document, please post them on the user mailing list. Questions on the Framework itself
            should be asked on StackOverflow (see https://spring.io/questions).
