<h2>Concurrency control</h2>

<p>The main categories are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>optimistic</strong> - check for violation at the end of transactions and repeat</li>
    <li><strong>pessimistic</strong> - block transaction to avoid violations</li>
    <li><strong>semi-optimistic</strong> - mix of the above</li>
</ul>
<p>Are usually implemented with <strong>Locking</strong>: Read, Write, Range</p>
<p>
    Optimistic Locking, Pessimistic Locking in JPA.

    Optimistic - Delay the checking of whether a transaction meets the isolation and other integrity rules (e.g.,
    serializability and recoverability) until its end, without blocking any of its (read, write) operations ("...and be
    optimistic about the rules being met..."), and then abort a transaction to prevent the violation, if the desired
    rules are to be violated upon its commit. An aborted transaction is immediately restarted and re-executed, which
    incurs an obvious overhead (versus executing it to the end only once). If not too many transactions are aborted,
    then being optimistic is usually a good strategy.

    Pessimistic - Block an operation of a transaction, if it may cause violation of the rules, until the possibility of
    violation disappears. Blocking operations is typically involved with performance reduction.

    Semi-optimistic - Block operations in some situations, if they may cause violation of some rules, and do not block
    in other situations while delaying rules checking (if needed) to transaction's end, as done with optimistic.
