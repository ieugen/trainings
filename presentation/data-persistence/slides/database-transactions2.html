<h2>Database transactions</h2>

<blockquote>
    A <strong>transaction</strong> against a database system.
    By definition it must be <strong>ACID</strong>:
</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Atomic</strong> - all or nothing</li>
    <li><strong>Consistent</strong> - operations are performed accurately</li>
    <li><strong>Isolated</strong> - regards transaction integrity visibility</li>
    <li><strong>Durable</strong> - committed transactions are permanent</li>
</ul>

    <p>Consistency</p>
    The consistency property ensures that the database remains in a consistent state before the start of the transaction
    and after the transaction is over (whether successful or not).

    The guarantee that any transactions started in the future necessarily see the effects of other transactions
    committed in the past[1][2]
    The guarantee that database constraints are not violated, particularly once a transaction commits[3][4][5][6]
    The guarantee that operations in transactions are performed accurately, correctly, and with validity, with respect
    to application semantics[7]
