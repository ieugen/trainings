<h2>Transaction propagation</h2>

<blockquote> What happens when we call a transactional method from within an existing transaction?

<aside class="notes">
    When using declarative transactions we must tell the container
    how it should manage the transaction.<br/>
    For example, when should the container start a transaction? What methods require a trans-
    action? Should the container start a transaction if one doesnâ€™t exist?
